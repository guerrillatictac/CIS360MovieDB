# CIS360MovieDB
This database is a student project assigned in the last two weeks of CIS 360 at Lander University. 

Our goal was to, in two weeks: 
*fully plan the DB with ER and Table diagrams
*implement the DB using Oracle SQL Developer
*Provide an application using Java Netbeans IDE which would have functions to update/insert/query the DB

The challenge coming from this is our planning phase had error which we did not have time to correct. The DB was in the end not
fully capable of what we set it out to be. In the future we would better plan the DB table attributes and hopefully have
more time to do so. With tests and an academic showcase to prepare for other classes, this project was very challenging.
